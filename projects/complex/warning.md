# Expected Output for Latest Create React App Versions
In the upcoming lecture, we will be building an image and then doing a quick run to make sure there are no errors. Create React App versions 5+ will have very different terminal output compared to what is shown in the videos. Many students are confusing this output for errors. If you see output that looks similar to the screenshot below, then, **you are safe to continue on with the course.**

Important - you should not be attempting to test the React app in the browser. This was never done in the video and is not expected to work since there is no port mapping!

**Expected and normal output for CRA v5+:**
